# Graph Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains Python implementations of various graph algorithms.
Each algorithm is provided in a separate Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and testing.

1. [General Discussion on Graphs](1_general_discussion_graphs.ipynb)
   - Introduction to graph theory concepts.

2. [Undirected Path](2_undirected_path.ipynb)
   - Implementation of an algorithm to find an undirected path in a graph.

3. [Count Connected Components](3_count_connected_components.ipynb)
   - Algorithm to count the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

4. [Largest Component](4_largest_component.ipynb)
   - Implementation to find the largest connected component in an undirected graph.

5. [Find Shortest Path](5_find_shortest_path.ipynb)
   - Algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.

6. [Island Count](6_island_count.ipynb)
   - Implementation to count the number of islands in a 2D grid.

7. [Minimum Island Size](7_minimum_island.ipynb)
   - Algorithm to find the minimum size of islands in a 2D grid.

## Usage

Feel free to explore each notebook for detailed explanations, code implementation, and example use cases. You can run the notebooks in your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment to experiment with the algorithms.
